# Election System Using Face Recognition (CNN)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **secure election/voting system** that uses **CNN-based face recognition** to authenticate voters before allowing them to cast a vote.  
By verifying voter identity through facial features, the system helps **prevent duplicate voting, impersonation, and election fraud** using AI and computer vision techniques.

## 📂 System Workflow
1. Voter registers with facial data  
2. CNN model is trained on registered faces  
3. During voting, live face capture is performed  
4. Face is verified against stored data  
5. Verified voter is allowed to cast vote

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how **AI-powered biometric authentication** can be applied to real-world systems like elections to enhance **security, transparency, and trust**.

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Improve model accuracy with larger datasets  
- Add multi-factor authentication  
- Deploy system on cloud infrastructure  
- Integrate blockchain for vote immutability
