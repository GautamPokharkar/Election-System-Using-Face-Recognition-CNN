📌 Project: Election System Using Face Recognition (CNN)
🧠 Project Overview

This project implements a secure election/voting system that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based face recognition to authenticate voters before they cast their vote. The system verifies each voter’s identity using their facial features, helping prevent fraud, duplicate voting, and unauthorized access. It combines computer vision, AI, and web application logic to create a more secure and reliable election process.
